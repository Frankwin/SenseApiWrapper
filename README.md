# SenseApiWrapper
Wrapper for the Sense (Energy Monitor) API 

This project provides a C# wrapper for the Sense (Energy Monitor) API. Any contributions are appreciated. I'm currently still working through adding additional functionality for the wrapper as I'm finding out different end points for the API as there's no official documentation for it. 

If you have any additional information, feel free to contact me.
